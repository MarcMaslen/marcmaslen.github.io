                    <h1>Marc Maslen - About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is Marc Maslen, I am a 21 year old computer Science Student working on various Projects on Game Design, Graphic Design and Software Development!
                        As of writing this I am currently on a placement year at a company called Awin, an affiliate marking company based in London.
                        <br><br>
                        My Journey Started when I finished school, I had spent my whole like going from year to year at school that I never really looked at what I wanted after. 
                        When school eventually came to an end I had no idea what I wanted and felt lost, so what did I do? I enjoyed building computers at the time so I decided IT / Computer Science would be great for me.
                        After starting college I relised very fast how much I enjoyed it, was getting really great grades and enjoyed doing the assigned work.
                        <br><br>
                        At this time I also landed my first part-time job at 17 working at CO-OP, I worked there over all for 4 years and I started building on my confidence and gaining some of my most valuable skills.
                         Within 6 months I was promoted to Team Leader / Supervisor and used the money I made to learn how to drive within the year.
                        <br><br>
                        I started to enjoy education and the process of learning something intresting, maybe its because I was doing something I enjoyed or because I liked the routine / structure but for the first time I starting thinking about going to University.
                         I spoke to my careers officer at college who helped me apply and write my person statment, where I got accepted to the University of Essex. I finished college with a D*D*D* equivalent to a A*A*A*.
                        <br><br>
                        I started university and moved out for the first time, it was nerve racking but made me more confident and sociable. 
                         I had been studying and working towards my goal of a first grade. While working part-time and improving on my skills. 
                        <br><br>
                        My time at University and Awin have taught me so much including various coding languages such as C#, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the list goes on.
                         These skills I have learnt are also great hobbies for me, such as this website I build from scratch.
                        <br><br>
                        I still have alot to learn and another few years at Uinversity but I will continue learning and developming my skills every chance I can!
