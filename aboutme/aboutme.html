              <h1>About Us</h1>
              <p>
                My name is Marc Maslen, I am a 21 year old computer Science Student working on various Projects on Game Design, Graphic Design and Software Development!
                As of writing this I am currently on a placement year at a company called Awin, an affiliate marking company based in London.
                <br><br>
                My Journey Started when I finished school, I had spent my time at school not really knowing what I wanted to do. 
                When school eventually came to an end I didn't know what  career to go down but the one hobby I knew I could turn into a job was
                 tech. I enjoyed building computers at the time so I decided IT / Computer Science would be great for me.
                After starting college I realized very fast how much I enjoyed it, I was getting really great grades and enjoyed doing the assigned work.
                <br><br>
                At this time I also landed my first part-time job at 17 working at CO-OP, I worked there for over 4 years and I started building on my confidence and gaining some of my most valuable skills.
                 Within 6 months I was promoted to Team Leader / Supervisor and used the money I made to learn how to drive within the year.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>I started to enjoy education and the process of learning something interesting, maybe its because I was doing something I enjoyed or because I liked the routine / structure but for the first time I started to think about going to University.
            I spoke to my careers officer at college who helped me apply and write my person statement, where I got accepted to the University of Essex. I finished college with a D*D*D* equivalent to a A*A*A*.
           <br><br>
           I started university and moved out for the first time, it was nerve racking but made me more confident and sociable. 
            I had been studying and working towards my goal of a first grade. While working part-time and improving on my skills. 
           <br><br>
           My time at University and Awin have taught me so much including various coding languages such as C#, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the list goes on.
            These skills I have learnt are also great hobbies for me, such as this website I build from scratch.
           <br><br>
           I still have a lot to learn and another few years at University but I will continue learning and developing my skills every chance I can!</p>
